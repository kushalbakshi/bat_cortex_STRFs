# Cortical STRF Analysis Code #

### The repository contains 3 folders - STRFbasics, STRFanalysis, STRFmodel ###

1. STRFbasics - contains code for generating spike triggered average (STA)/Spectrotemporal Receptive Field (STRF) from multiunit raw spike data and spike sorted units using the Dynamic Moving Ripple (DMR) stimuli

2. STRFanalysis - contains code to extract information from the STA/STRF such as direction selectivity, integration time, separability, convolution with predicted PSTH

3. STRFmodel
