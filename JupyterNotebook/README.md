# Jupyter Notebook to plot data and run basic stats on STRF features

+ All the files in this folder are needed to run the Jupyter notebook as well as the `anaconda-python` distribution in the link below. You will need to update the file paths in the notebook to where they are stored on your machine, locally. 

+ The Jupyter Notebook can be run on your local machine after installing anaconda which can be found [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

+ Google colab is another way to run the notebook, however, that requires placing all the files into a google drive and mounting the drive to the Notebook.
